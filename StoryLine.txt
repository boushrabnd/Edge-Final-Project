0#0#{char_1} woke up this morning, after having a terrible nightmare, feeling dizzy and unstable. {char_1_gender} tried to remember what happened the night before. #Will {char_1_gender} remember? Type (1) for yes, Type (2) no: #1#6
1#1.1#Loud cars. Bright lights. It's a busy night in the city. {char_1_gender} was looking for someone. {char_1_gender} makes a short call which drove {char_1} crazily mad.#Who was {char_1} talking to? Type (1) for her sister, Type (2) for her stepfather: #2#5
2#1.1.1#{char_1}'s sister is recently divorced. Her husband has always been that handsome bastard nobody liked. He was rich, and her father was greedy. You get the combination. She called {char_1} to pass the news that she got divorced, which made {char_1} relieved. But then she told {char_1} she was to end her life.Since {char_1} was troubled looking for the man, {char_1_gender} told her to cut off the silly talk and hung up immediately. Who is the man {char_1} was looking for?# Type (1) for a dual spy, Type (2) for a hairdresser: #3#4
3#1.1.1.1#After {char_1} hung up the phone. {char_1_gender} kept walking through the dark, gloomy suburbs when suddenly {char_1_gender} was hit hard on the head... and passed out. (2)#Type 1 for a crazy ending ;) : #9#
4#1.1.1.2#{char_1}'s hair needs to be styled. The thing is, {char_1_gender} has an appointment with a stout business man after an hour. {char_1_gender} had a deal with her favourite hairdresser who moved his hair saloon somewhere new. {char_1}'s navigational skills suck, so {char_1_gender} couldn't find the beauty saloon. {char_1_gender} had to go to the businessman but when she arrived at the company, {char_1_gender} was literally bitten by a dog. Then {char_1_gender} fell hard on the ground and passed out ... #Type 1 for a crazy ending ;) : #9#
5#1.1.2#He wants {char_1} back home. He needs someone to serve him, as he is penniless and drunken. The typical stepfather style he used with {char_1} was not any amicable. And {char_1_gender} needn't take that anymore. {char_1_gender} hung up the phone and dropped it on the ground. It was a new iPhone. While {char_1_gender} was cursing the day {char_1_gender} saw that brainless man-ish stepfather, {char_1_gender} bumped into one of the street lights, and fell unconscious. It was over, {char_1_gender} wouldn't have been looking for that stupid old shopkeeper anyway. He wouldn't apologize for giving her rotten beef anyways.#Type 1 for a crazy ending ;) : #9#
6#1.2#{char_1} wakes up not remembering what happened last night. However, {char_1_gender} finds a pen and paper beside the bed, and tries to remember anything. {char_1_gender} does remember one thing, and writes a single word.#What is that word? Type (1) for "Heaven", Type (2) for "Pizza": #7#8
7#1.2.1#"Heaven, I'm in heaven .. And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak... And I seem to find the happiness I seek when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek." That song rang in {char_1}'s mind. It was a wedding, a tall man and {char_1}'s best friend. There was a guy wearing dirty, baggy clothes standing outside of the hall and looking through the window. While {char_1} was talking to the bride, {char_1_gender} saw the guy and went outside and was about to ask him why he was there. But then the lights went out, screams came out of every mouth, the wedding turned into a massacre, and {char_1} was trussed and drugged.#Type 1 for a crazy ending ;) : #9#
8#1.2.2#{char_1} remembered that disgusting, medicine-like pepperoni pizza {char_1_gender} had with some friends on Tuesday. Then came two funny-looking men wearing sheer socks in their heads, they had two toy guns with them. "THIS IS A TICK-UP!" screamed one of them. "You mean stick-up?" said a customer laughing. "SSSH YOU JERK. PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEADS AND GIMME ALL THE PIZZA YOU HAVE OR WE GONNA KILL YOU" Of course, the whole restaurant burst into laughter, but then the two men started to shoot water at everyone using their toy guns until the police came and took the crazy couple. Then, everyone went out of the restaurant. {char_1} was grabbing a cab when he saw one of the funny two coming closer and closer with a real gun in his hand. {char_1} ran home as fast as {char_1_gender} could and hid behind a tree. When it felt safe, {char_1} kept running and fell into a sink.#Type 1 for a crazy ending ;) : #9#
9#2.0#{char_1} now remembers what happened. {char_1_gender} looks around, this is definetly not home. White walls. White floor. Dim light. Dead silence. Is this a grave? There is one door at the end of this long, long room. {char_1} tries to get up from bed, but {char_1_gender} looks down to find the floor out of reach. {char_1_gender} takes a leap and is finally standing up. {char_1_gender} takes careful, heavy steps, swiftly moving closer and closer, {char_1_gender} opens the door. And there was an awaiting surprise...###
